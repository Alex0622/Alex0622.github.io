This is a website mainly used to test HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I've decided to use this website for personal purpose as well, such as showing my art, Discord bots, Minecraft servers, etc. 
You can help by report issues and bugs related to my website [here](https://github.com/Alex0622/Alex0622.github.io/issues) or through Discord (**Alex22#7756**). If you have experience with creating websites I'll be happy that you help me contributing in it, I'll be adding you at the bottom of the page as well as a "thank you" for your service. But I recommend that you don't implement your website in mine, one of the main ideas of my website is that it must me fully new and creative.
